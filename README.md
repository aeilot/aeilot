## More Detailed
  
I am a 14y/o student who code by avocation from China. I write mainly C++, partly Swift and Python, and Java while needed.

I made innovative projects, like [Daily Notes](https://github.com/aeilot/DailyNotes), and I have a great many ideas waiting to be realized. I play an active part in many Open Source repositories, especially those belong to my friend [@MrWillCom](https://github.com/MrWillCom).

I have participated in WWDC Scholarship twice (both failed though), and will try harder in the future. Also, I have taken part in several contests in Programming, such as NOIP (National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces), and got prizes. [Here](https://github.com/aeilot/ProblemSet)'s where I practice.

At my leisure, I love filming and taking photos. Follow my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/louisaeilot/), [YouTube (NOT AVAILABLE)](#notavailable) and [BiliBili](https://space.bilibili.com/378981479) for more.

I'm willing to make friends from home and abroad. Here's my [email](mailto:louis.aeilot@icloud.com), my [Telegram](https://t.me/aeilotd) and my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aeilot)

In the end, I'm proud to introduce my elder sister [@QD-lazy-tm](https://github.com/QD-lazy-tm) who is 16.
